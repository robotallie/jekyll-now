I'm a left-handed science fiction problem lover. I teach innovation to executives in my spare time, for fun. I studied learning, attention and memory in a cognitive science laboratory in Xi'an, China, and love Barbara Oakley's [Learning How to Learn MOOC on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), which should be required for all humans in order to graduate middle school.

Problems That Interest Me:
- Recommending children's books to parents based on parents' TV and movie preferences. (i.e. "If you loved 'Sherlock Holmes,' you'll love reading 'Nancy Drew' again with your daughter."
- Finding the likelihood that a restaurant will stay in business for the next five years based on which block it plans to open shop.
