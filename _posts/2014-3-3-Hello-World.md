title: Filling in the Blanks
published: true

I've been working on a lot of exciting projects this fall using machine learning and plan to share different aspects of my work on this blog. Whether it's using `pandas` for plotting during EDA, or getting all my work into scikit-learn's `pipelines`, I want to blog it all here.

Partly, it's a chance for me, as a social learner, to process my understanding of model creation and evaluation. Partly, it's an opportunity to provide some simple tutorials that I would have enjoyed learning from during my first stages of data science. 

I stay current with machine learning on Twitter at [twitter.com/robot_allie](https://twitter.com/robot_allie "My Tweet Storm"), so please come by, say hello, and tell me what projects you're working on right now. If you have interesting data that's not very clean yet, I'd be really interested in hearing your plans for filling in the blanks (if you know what I mean).
